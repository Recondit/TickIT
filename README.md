TickIT is a minimalistic TODO and task tracking app that I made using Google's Flutter framework and connected it to a cloud Firestore backend in 12th grade. The main purpose behind this project was to get familiar and run through the full development process from design to deployment on the play store. The application has a functional signin system , themes as well as cloud syncing so if you were to switch devices , all your task would still be right there.
